Next.js is commonly used with WordPress in a "headless" configuration, where WordPress serves purely as a content management system (CMS) and Next.js handles the front-end display. This approach leverages the familiar WordPress admin interface for content creators while providing the performance, flexibility, and modern developer experience of Next.js.

How They Work Together
In a headless setup, the front-end (Next.js) is decoupled from the back-end (WordPress).

WordPress as the CMS: Content is created and managed within the standard WordPress dashboard.
Data Fetching: The Next.js application retrieves this content using the WordPress REST API (built-in) or, more commonly for performance and flexibility, with the WPGraphQL plugin.
Next.js as the Front-end: Next.js uses techniques like Static Site Generation (SSG) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to render the pages, resulting in a fast, performant, and SEO-friendly website.
Content Updates: Features like Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and webhooks allow pages to be updated in the background without requiring a full site re-build and re-deployment every time content changes in WordPress.

Key Benefits
Performance: Decoupling from traditional PHP rendering leads to faster load times and better Core Web Vitals, which improves the user experience and SEO.
Developer Experience: Developers can work within a modern React environment with powerful features like TypeScript support, automatic image optimization, and file-based routing.
Editorial Control: Content teams continue to use the user-friendly WordPress dashboard and its extensive plugin ecosystem (like Advanced Custom Fields) for content management.
